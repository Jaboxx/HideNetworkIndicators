A small Xposed module that brings back the original AOSP look on custom roms by hiding the network activity indicators.

This app requires the [Xposed Framework](http://repo.xposed.info/) and has no effect without it.

* **1.3** : Updated for Lollipop
* **1.2** : New method of hiding indicators, should now have better compatibility on pre-4.4 roms
